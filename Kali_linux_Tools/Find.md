find Command
Searching the target system for important information and potential privilege escalation vectors can be fruitful. The built-in “find” command is useful and worth keeping in your arsenal.

Below are some useful examples for the “find” command.

Find files:

find . -name flag1.txt: find the file named “flag1.txt” in the current directory
find /home -name flag1.txt: find the file names “flag1.txt” in the /home directory
find / -type d -name config: find the directory named config under “/”
find / -type f -perm 0777: find files with the 777 permissions (files readable, writable, and executable by all users)
find / -perm a=x: find executable files
find /home -user frank: find all files for user “frank” under “/home”
find / -mtime 10: find files that were modified in the last 10 days
find / -atime 10: find files that were accessed in the last 10 day
find / -cmin -60: find files changed within the last hour (60 minutes)
find / -amin -60: find files accesses within the last hour (60 minutes)
find / -size 50M: find files with a 50 MB size
This command can also be used with (+) and (-) signs to specify a file that is larger or smaller than the given size.



The example above returns files that are larger than 100 MB. It is important to note that the “find” command tends to generate errors which sometimes makes the output hard to read. This is why it would be wise to use the “find” command with “-type f 2>/dev/null” to redirect errors to “/dev/null” and have a cleaner output (below).




Folders and files that can be written to or executed from:

find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null : Find world-writeable folders
find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null: Find world-writeable folders
find / -perm -o w -type d 2>/dev/null: Find world-writeable folders
The reason we see three different “find” commands that could potentially lead to the same result can be seen in the manual document. As you can see below, the perm parameter affects the way “find” works.



find / -perm -o x -type d 2>/dev/null : Find world-executable folders
Find development tools and supported languages:

find / -name perl*
find / -name python*
find / -name gcc*
Find specific file permissions:

Below is a short example used to find files that have the SUID bit set. The SUID bit allows the file to run with the privilege level of the account that owns it, rather than the account which runs it. This allows for an interesting privilege escalation path,we will see in more details on task 6. The example below is given to complete the subject on the “find” command.

find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null: Find files with the SUID bit, which allows us to run the file with a higher privilege level than the current user.




find user read, write permission in the compromise system:

```
find / -type d -user john -writable 2>/dev/null
```
