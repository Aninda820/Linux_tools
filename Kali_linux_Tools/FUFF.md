```
 ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://MACHINE_IP/FUZZ
```


`ffuf -u http://{MachineIp}/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-words.txt -H 'Host: FUZZ.futurevera.thm' -fs {size}`

- This command gave me two subdomains and both of them had a message on the screen saying  
    `{subdomain}.futurevera.thm is only availiable via internal VPN`
- Got nothing important while enumerating directories or files.

| Option                                                                        | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `ffuf`                                                                        | Starts the Fast Web Fuzzer.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `-u 'http://10.10.74.25/assets/index.php?FUZZ=id'`                            | URL to fuzz. The word `FUZZ` is the placeholder that will be replaced by each word from the wordlist. So this means you are fuzzing the **parameter name**, like `?username=id`, `?cmd=id`, etc. |
| `-mc all`                                                                     | Match **all** HTTP status codes (default is usually 200 only). Useful to catch unusual responses (like 302, 403, etc.).                                                                          |
| `-ic`                                                                         | Makes the matching **case-insensitive**. Useful when parameter names might have varying capitalization.                                                                                          |
| `-t 100`                                                                      | Run 100 concurrent threads (faster but heavier on the server).                                                                                                                                   |
| `-w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words-lowercase.txt` | Wordlist to use for the fuzzing â€” common lowercase web-related words.                                                                                                                            |
| `-fs 0`                                                                       | Filter out responses with **0 bytes** in size (usually means empty or invalid responses).                                                                                                        |
